“Build a Claude Code Calendar plugin. Know that the skeleton beginnings of this already exist in the directory at the location claude_calendar_plugin. The plugin needs to be able to interact with a users calendar through the Rails API. Build in all the necessary functions to be able to read a users calendar events. -with the plugin installed in the claude code, I want to be able to write a natural language request or query and for a claude code to be able to execute that query and return appropriate information. An example request would be: Add a haircut to my calendar on Tuesday at 1pm.It should be able to post and create that event through the Rails API.” —completion-promise “One event was posted by natural language through the Claude Code Calendar plug-in to the rails app. Return the event ID of the posted event.”
